#### How can you prove that x + r , and xr is an irrational, if x is irrational, and we know r is rational?

To do this, proof by contraditions is best approach.  We know that r is rational, therefore, we have that r = a/b, where a and b have the smallest redcued form possible.  This means that a and b are both not even, and do not equal each other, and crucially, b ≠ 0.  When this is the case, it is possible to write and let x also be a rational number.

If so, then $x + r = \frac{m}{n} + \frac{a}{b} = \frac{am + bn}{bn} $

Once we are able to say this, it is clear this this is a rational number.

But, we know that x is NOT rational, so therefore cannot be stated as a fration, it is NOT possible for x + r to be a fraction, and therefore is not rational.  Proof by contradiction.

For the case of $x*r$, take the example again and state that if $x$and $r$are both rationals, and we assume that x is a rational, and we know r is a rational, then we have:

$x = \frac{m}{n} $for some m and n not equal to each other, both even, or 0, and then we have that

$x * r = \frac{m}{n} * \frac{a}{b} = \frac{am}{nb}$

This is clearly a rational number.  But, we know that x is NOT rational, so therefore cannot be stated as a fration, it is NOT possible for x * r to be a fraction, and therefore is not rational.  Proof by contradiction.

## Prove that these values are 0

# Rolles Theorem 

"This means, that if a function have the same value in the extreme of an interval, then there exist a point in which the derivative is zero in this interval, in other words, there exist point which are maximum or minimum at least local, in the interval."

In other words, you would check a period, say, $[a,b]$

If $f(a) = f(b)$, then this first part of the theorem has been satisfied
If $f'(c)$ exists, then we knowm, as some stage, it will be equal to 0, because of Rolles Theorem.

This is useful to use, because we can use it for powerful rules, see below

For example, two beautiful proofs for some interesting problems are below:

Assume that you have a sequence.  This sequence $\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i$ is generated from some $a_i$s in such a way that:
