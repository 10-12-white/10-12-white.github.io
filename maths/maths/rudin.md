#### How can you prove that x + r , and xr is an irrational, if x is irrational, and we know r is rational?

To do this, proof by contraditions is best approach.  We know that r is rational, therefore, we have that r = a/b, where a and b have the smallest redcued form possible.  This means that a and b are both not even, and do not equal each other, and crucially, b ≠ 0.  When this is the case, it is possible to write and let x also be a rational number.

If so, then x + r = (m/n) + (a/b) = (am + bn)\(bn)

Once we are able to say this, it is clear this this is a rational number.
