#### How can you prove that x + r , and xr is an irrational, if x is irrational, and we know r is rational?

To do this, proof by contraditions is best approach.  We know that r is rational, therefore, we have that r = a/b, where a and b have the smallest redcued form possible.  This means that a and b are both not even, and do not equal each other, and crucially, b ≠ 0.  When this is the case, it is possible to write and let x also be a rational number.

If so, then $x + r = \frac{m}{n} + \frac{a}{b} = \frac{am + bn}{bn} $

Once we are able to say this, it is clear this this is a rational number.

But, we know that x is NOT rational, so therefore cannot be stated as a fration, it is NOT possible for x + r to be a fraction, and therefore is not rational.  Proof by contradiction.

For the case of $x*r$, take the example again and state that if $x$and $r$are both rationals, and we assume that x is a rational, and we know r is a rational, then we have:

$x = \frac{m}{n} $for some m and n not equal to each other, both even, or 0, and then we have that

$ x * r = \frac{m}{n} * \frac{a}{b} = \frac{am}{nb} $

This is clearly a rational number.  But, we know that x is NOT rational, so therefore cannot be stated as a fration, it is NOT possible for x * r to be a fraction, and therefore is not rational.  Proof by contradiction.
