            <h2 class="text-4xl font-extrabold mb-6 text-cream">Introduction</h2>
          
<p class="text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed">The 2025 Australian Quantum-Resistant Cybersecurity (AusQRC) Day was a day conference that highlighted the critical challenges and strategic direction for migrating to Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). The Australian government, through the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD), has signalled alignment with NIST PQC standards as the most suitable cryptographic security framework for national requirements. </p>p

<p class="text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed">Specifically, the ASD endorses the lattice-based ML-KEM (Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism), noting that the imperative of quantum-safety warrants the overhead. The government is prioritising future-proofing long-lived data systems against the "harvest now, decrypt later" threat, despite the associated operational costs and performance impact. The ASD generally encourages a pure-PQC transition by its 2030 goal, favouring the higher security level ML-KEM-1024 for long-term use, while accepting ML-KEM-768 until 2030.</p>

<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-8 text-deep-accent">Global Standards and Trust Landscape</h3>

<p class="text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed">The global landscape of cryptographic standards is divided between adherence to NIST-selected algorithms and independent national security mandates. While many countries align with NIST PQC standards, key nations maintain unique, stringent standards for their classified systems.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>United States: Driven by NIST for public standards and the NSA (via CNSA 2.0) for classified systems, the US sets a pure PQC requirement for National Security Systems (NSS) by 2035, viewing hybrid schemes strictly as an interim measure.</li> 
                <li>European Union/Germany/France: Bodies like the German BSI and French ANSSI recommend NIST algorithms but also endorse alternatives (e.g., FrodoKEM, Classic McEliece) for diversification and actively recommend hybrid schemes during the transition.</li> 
                <li>China and South Korea: Both nations have pursued developing and standardising their own national PQC algorithms separate from the NIST process (e.g., South Korea's HAETAE and China's domestic candidates), reflecting a priority for digital sovereignty.</li> 
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-8 text-deep-accent">Major Challenges and Transition Impact</h3>

        <p class="text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed">The overall transition to PQC presents significant operational and financial challenges:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Resource and Cost Overheads: The shift, particularly to lattice-based cryptography, demands an estimated 30x increase in memory for some applications. </li>
                <li>Data Footprint: PQC schemes generally involve significantly longer cryptographic keys and signatures, impacting data storage and transmission protocols. </li>
                <li>Implementation and Interoperability: Hurdles include updating codebases, ensuring backwards compatibility, and navigating the issue of multiple global standards to enforce a consistent security baseline. The risk of backwards-forcing attacks against PQC schemes is a strong motivator for a coordinated, enforced standard. </li>
              </ul>      

<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-8 text-deep-accent">Strategic Solutions and Timelines</h3>
            
<p class="text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed"> The conference emphasised practical solutions and set expectations for the migration:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Hybrid Schemes: The use of hybrid cryptographic schemes (combining classical and PQC algorithms) is considered a sound and necessary transitional strategy to manage risk and security during the changeover period. </li>
                <li>Authentication Advancement: The increasing use of Merkle tree authentication was noted as a valuable technique to provide an extra layer of integrity and authenticity to digital signatures. </li>
                <li>The 2030 Goal: The consensus is that 2030 represents an ambitious, deadline for a complete transition across all industries, depending on the current state of industry</li>
                <li>A phased, measured approach that prioritises critical and long-lived data systems is required.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed">The global landscape of cryptographic standards is divided between adherence to NIST-selected algorithms and independent national security mandates. While there are many countries that align with NIST PQC standards, several are creating their own.</p>

            <p class="text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed">United States: Driven by NIST for public standards and the NSA (via CNSA 2.0) for classified systems, the US sets a pure PQC requirement for National Security Systems (NSS) by 2035, viewing hybrid schemes strictly as an interim measure.</p>

This is partially due to the fact that their own governments have their own departments working on cryptography standards.</p> 

            <p class="text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed">China and South Korea: Both nations have pursued developing and standardising their own national PQC algorithms separate from the NIST process (e.g., South Korea's HAETAE and China's domestic candidates), reflecting a priority for digital sovereignty and national control over cryptographic assurance.  There is no further information provided on these schemes.</p>

            The overall transition to PQC presents significant operational and financial challenges:

            <p class="text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed">Resource and Cost Overheads: The shift, particularly to lattice-based cryptography, demands an estimated 30x increase in length for some applications.</p>
            <p class="text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed">Data Footprint: PQC schemes generally involve significantly longer cryptographic keys and signatures, impacting data storage and transmission protocols , see table below:</p>
            <p class="text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed">Hurdles include updating codebases, ensuring backwards compatibility, and navigating the issue of multiple global standards to enforce a consistent security baseline. The risk of backwards-forcing attacks against PQC schemes is a strong motivator for a coordinated, enforced standard.</p>
            <p class="text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed">Other problems are things like Certificate Authorities need to be able to understand both PQC and non-PQC certificates, so will need to be standardised earlier than the use of the certificates in question.  And then they will also need to be responsible for any secure down-grade which may be required by one of the communicating parties, if they are not advanced enough to accept PQC keys.</p>
