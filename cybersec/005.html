            <h2 class="text-4xl font-extrabold mb-6 text-cream">Introduction</h2>
            <p class="text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed">GoBruteforcer is a modular, Golang-based malware platform designed to compromise Linux-based web servers. It operates primarily as a botnet that spreads via high-volume brute-force attacks against internet-facing services like FTP, MySQL, and phpMyAdmin. Recent variants have integrated "AI-aware" targeting strategies, specifically exploiting the insecure default configurations often found in AI-generated deployment scripts.</p>

  <p class="text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed">Check Point said it identified a more sophisticated version of the Golang malware in mid-2025, packing in a heavily obfuscated IRC bot that's rewritten in the cross-platform programming language, improved persistence mechanisms, process-masking techniques, and dynamic credential lists.</p>

  <p class="text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed">Check Point Research (CPR) observed a GoBruteforcer campaign targeting databases of crypto and blockchain projects. On one compromised host, we recovered Go-based tools, a TRON balance scanner and TRON and BSC “token-sweep” utilities, together with a file containing ~23,000 TRON addresses. On-chain transaction analysis involving the botnet operators’ recipient wallets shows that at least some of these financially motivated attacks were successful.</p>

  <p class="text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed">The list of credentials includes a combination of common usernames and passwords (e.g., myuser:Abcd@123 or appeaser:admin123456) that can accept remote logins. The choice of these names is not happenstance, as they have been used in database tutorials and vendor documentation, all of which have been used to train Large language models (LLMs), causing them to produce code snippets with the same default usernames.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-deep-accent">Tactical Overview</h2>
            <p class="text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed"></p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-8 text-deep-accent">Victimology and Patterns</h3>
            
            <p class="text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed">GoFroce tends to target Linux-based systems that have poor hygeien or password hardening.  They tend to target systems that have been poorly set up or do not have strong authetation methods.  For example, their recent victims continue in this trend:</p>

            <ul>
            <li><span class="mitre-id">Initial Discovery (2023): </span> First identified targeting weak FTP and phpMyAdmin credentials on XAMPP-like stacks. </li>
        <li><span class="mitre-id">Evolution (2024):</span>Expanded capabilities to include multiple architectures (x86, x64, ARM), allowing it to infect everything from high-end servers to IoT devices.</li>
        <li><span class="mitre-id">Current Phase (2025-2026):</span>Shifted focus toward "AI-ready" environments, targeting users who deploy servers using LLM-provided boilerplate code without changing default security settings.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-8 text-deep-accent">Attack Patterns</h3>
            <p class="text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed"></p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><span class="mitre-id">March 2023 (Unit 42): </span> First documented as a Go-based scanner targeting x86 and ARM.</li>
                <li><span class="mitre-id">September 2025 (Black Lotus Labs/Lumen):</span> Research confirmed that GoBruteforcer and SystemBC share significant infrastructure. Lumen discovered that roughly 80% of compromised nodes were VPS systems, often acting as proxy relays for more sensitive nation-state or high-level criminal traffic.</li>
                <li><span class="mitre-id">January 2026 (Check Point report):</span> Identification of the latest "AI-Aware" variant, which has scaled to over 50,000 active vulnerable targets</li>
            </ul>
 
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-8 text-deep-accent">General Recommendations</h3>
            <p class="text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed">The following is advice coming from several threat intelligence reporting companies, such as Check Point, Trend Micro, Unit 42 and Recorded Future.  Overall, they recommend that: </p>

            <ul>
                <li>  <span class="mitre-id">Sanitize AI Workflows: Implement a policy requiring all AI-generated deployment scripts to undergo a security review, specifically focusing on the removal of default credentials.</li>
                <li>  <span class="mitre-id">Implement "Identity-First" Access: Transition away from exposing management ports (FTP/MySQL) to the open web. Use Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) or VPNs for administrative tasks.
</li>
                <li>  <span class="mitre-id">Egress Filtering: Monitor and block IRC traffic (typically ports 6660-6669) from web servers, as this is a primary indicator of a GoBruteforcer infection.
</li>
                <li>  <span class="mitre-id">Deployment of Honeypots: Set up "low-interaction" traps with default credentials to identify and block the specific IP ranges currently being used by the GoBruteforcer botnet.</li>
                <li>  <span class="mitre-id"></li>
            </ul>
                
            <p class="text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed"></p>

            <p class="text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed"></p>

<p class="text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed">TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)<p>

        <p><strong></strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="mitre-id">T1110 (Brute Force):</span> Uses a massive built-in list of credentials, now updated to include common AI-generated defaults. </li>
        <li><span class="mitre-id">T1059.004 (Command and Scripting Interpreter: Unix Shell):</span>Utilizes PHP web shells for initial access and execution.</li>
        <li><span class="mitre-id">T1071.001 (Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols):</span> Uses IRC (Internet Relay Chat) for Command and Control (C2) communication to stay under the radar of traditional HTTP/S monitoring.</li>
        <li><span class="mitre-id">T1027 (Obfuscated Files or Information):</span> Employs the "Garble" tool for Go-specific obfuscation and renames malicious processes to look like system services (e.g., init).</li>

                As of January 2026, a new variant has been observed with enhanced Cryptocurrency Sweeping modules. This version no longer just waits for a miner to run; it actively scans databases for TRON and Binance Smart Chain private keys or seed phrases to drain wallets instantly. It has also improved its concurrency, allowing a single infected node to brute-force up to 95 targets simultaneously.
