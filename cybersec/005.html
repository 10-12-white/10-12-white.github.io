            <h2 class="text-4xl font-extrabold mb-6 text-cream">Introduction</h2>
            <p class="text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed">GoBruteforcer is a modular, Golang-based malware platform designed to compromise Linux-based web servers. It operates primarily as a botnet that spreads via high-volume brute-force attacks against internet-facing services like FTP, MySQL, and phpMyAdmin. Recent variants have integrated "AI-aware" targeting strategies, specifically exploiting the insecure default configurations often found in AI-generated deployment scripts.</p>

  <p class="text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed">Check Point said it identified a more sophisticated version of the Golang malware in mid-2025, packing in a heavily obfuscated IRC bot that's rewritten in the cross-platform programming language, improved persistence mechanisms, process-masking techniques, and dynamic credential lists.</p>

  <p class="text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed">Check Point Research (CPR) observed a GoBruteforcer campaign targeting databases of crypto and blockchain projects. On one compromised host, we recovered Go-based tools, a TRON balance scanner and TRON and BSC “token-sweep” utilities, together with a file containing ~23,000 TRON addresses. On-chain transaction analysis involving the botnet operators’ recipient wallets shows that at least some of these financially motivated attacks were successful.</p>

  <p class="text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed">The list of credentials includes a combination of common usernames and passwords (e.g., myuser:Abcd@123 or appeaser:admin123456) that can accept remote logins. The choice of these names is not happenstance, as they have been used in database tutorials and vendor documentation, all of which have been used to train Large language models (LLMs), causing them to produce code snippets with the same default usernames.</p>
            
            <img src="https://10-12-white.github.io/cybersec/img/palo_cidr.webp" alt="Attack Methods" class="rounded-lg border border-moss-green w-full my-8">
            
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-deep-accent">Recent History</h2>
            
            <p class="text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed">Check Point compared the credential list used in GoBruteforcer campaigns against a database of approximately 10 million leaked passwords and found an overlap of roughly 2.44%. This gives us a baseline for a rough upper limit on the number of hosts that might accept one of the passwords that GoBruteforcer has at its disposal: approximately 54.6 thousand MySQL instances and 13.7 thousand PostgreSQL instances (note that this estimate does not account for correct usernames, host-based access restrictions, or other policy controls). Even with a low success rate, the large number of exposed services makes this type of attack an economically-attractive option. Our assumptions are supported by Google’s 2024 Cloud Threat Horizons report, which found that weak or missing credentials accounted for 47.2% of initial access vectors in compromised cloud surfaces. In practice, attackers do not need expensive techniques or zero-day exploits to gain access. They can simply try common usernames and passwords such as admin, 123456 or password1 until they obtain access (the bruteforce model). The evidence shows that this approach still succeeds far too often.</p>

            <p class="text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed">In the activity observed by Check Point, an internet-exposed FTP service on servers running XAMPP is used as an initial access vector to upload a PHP web shell, which is then used to download and execute an updated version of the IRC bot using a shell script based on the system architecture. Once a host is successfully infected, it can serve three different uses:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="mitre-id">Run the brute-force</span> component to attempt password logins for FTP, MySQL, Postgres, and phpMyAdmin across the internet</li>
                <li><span class="mitre-id">Host and serve</span>  payloads to other compromised systems, </li>
                <li><span class="mitre-id">Host IRC-style control</span> endpoints or act as a backup command-and-control (C2) for resilience</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-8 text-deep-accent">Victimology and Patterns</h3>
            
            <p class="text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed">GoFroce tends to target Linux-based systems that have poor hygeien or password hardening.  They tend to target systems that have been poorly set up or do not have strong authetation methods.  For example, their recent victims continue in this trend:</p>

            <ul>
            <li><span class="mitre-id">Initial Discovery (2023): </span> First identified targeting weak FTP and phpMyAdmin credentials on XAMPP-like stacks. </li>
        <li><span class="mitre-id">Evolution (2024):</span>Expanded capabilities to include multiple architectures (x86, x64, ARM), allowing it to infect everything from high-end servers to IoT devices.</li>
        <li><span class="mitre-id">Current Phase (2025-2026):</span>Shifted focus toward "AI-ready" environments, targeting users who deploy servers using LLM-provided boilerplate code without changing default security settings.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-8 text-deep-accent">Attack Patterns and history</h3>
            <p class="text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed">At the same time, the small set of credentials used by the FTP bruteforcer strongly indicates that XAMPP installations are among GoBruteforcer’s intended targets. When attackers obtain access to XAMPP FTP using a standard account (commonly daemon or nobody) and a weak default password, the typical next step is to upload a web shell into the webroot.</p>

            <p class="text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed">To upload a web shell, attackers may also use other vectors, for example, misconfigured MySQL servers or phpMyAdmin panels. Published case studies and write-ups demonstrate practical techniques for achieving code execution or uploading shells through phpMyAdmin when the application or host is misconfigured.</p>

            <p class="text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed">The attackers still use the same PHP web shell that we observed two years earlier (SHA256: de7994277a81cf48f575f7245ec782c82452bb928a55c7fae11c2702cc308b8b). In addition, the samples we observed use the same hashed password for user authentication.</p>

            <p class="text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed">We also suspect the presence of other distribution chains, as we found hosts belonging to the botnet that did not have a web shell installed.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><span class="mitre-id">March 2023 (Unit 42): </span> First documented as a Go-based scanner targeting x86 and ARM.</li>
                <li><span class="mitre-id">September 2025 (Black Lotus Labs/Lumen):</span> Research confirmed that GoBruteforcer and SystemBC share significant infrastructure. Lumen discovered that roughly 80% of compromised nodes were VPS systems, often acting as proxy relays for more sensitive nation-state or high-level criminal traffic.</li>
                <li><span class="mitre-id">January 2026 (Check Point report):</span> Identification of the latest "AI-Aware" variant, which has scaled to over 50,000 active vulnerable targets</li>
            </ul>
 
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-8 text-deep-accent">General Recommendations</h3>
            
            <p class="text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed">The following is advice coming from several threat intelligence reporting companies, such as Check Point, Trend Micro, Unit 42 and Recorded Future.  Overall, they recommend that: </p>

            <ul>
                <li>  <span class="mitre-id">Sanitize AI Workflows: Implement a policy requiring all AI-generated deployment scripts to undergo a security review, specifically focusing on the removal of default credentials.</li>
                <li>  <span class="mitre-id">Implement "Identity-First" Access: Transition away from exposing management ports (FTP/MySQL) to the open web. Use Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) or VPNs for administrative tasks.
</li>
                <li>  <span class="mitre-id">Egress Filtering: Monitor and block IRC traffic (typically ports 6660-6669) from web servers, as this is a primary indicator of a GoBruteforcer infection.
</li>
                <li>  <span class="mitre-id">Deployment of Honeypots: Set up "low-interaction" traps with default credentials to identify and block the specific IP ranges currently being used by the GoBruteforcer botnet.</li>
                <li>  <span class="mitre-id"></li>
            </ul>

                As of January 2026, a new variant has been observed with enhanced Cryptocurrency Sweeping modules. This version no longer just waits for a miner to run; it actively scans databases for TRON and Binance Smart Chain private keys or seed phrases to drain wallets instantly. It has also improved its concurrency, allowing a single infected node to brute-force up to 95 targets simultaneously.
